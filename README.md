# Dergcave
WIP clicker game made in Godot

Content is roughly 80% finished. Mostly missing some art assets and miscellaneous content that should not take too long to create.
Also missing some thorough testing, I have added a ton of stuff without properly going through each of them. They should work? 
but development is development, things always have unintended side effects and break because of small brain implementations.
But should still work.
I hope.

Attached also a working build of the game, not completely tested, so late game and some upgrades might be broken, but early game should work. I hope.
