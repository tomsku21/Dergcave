# Dergon Hoard
The hoard building idle clicker game mad on Godot.
You pet the dragon as he roams around his cave, using the affection gained to get gold, gems, mushrooms etc. to grow the hoard. The numbers don't get to insane numbers like in cookie clicker, but there is still quite a lot of hours to be spent with this dragon.

Main content is finished and the game is released on itch.io, found at: https://dalnari.itch.io/dergon-hoard

Will still be making balance adjustments if I get feedback that the end-game side is unfair or too lax.
Next major update will be about giving the kobolds and dragon a ton more animations and interactions with each other and fielded buildings.
